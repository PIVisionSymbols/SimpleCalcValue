# SimpleCalcValue
Simple Calculation Value Symbol

Add the 3 symbol files to C:\Program Files\PIPC\PIVision\Scripts\app\editor\symbols\ext\ on your PI Vision server (assuming the default installation folder).

This symbol is a simple value symbol that perform simple calculations on up to three Data Sources.  

Once the symbol is added to a PI Vision Display the default value is the value of the first data source.  To create a simple calculation right click on the symbol and select 'Format Symbol'. In the configuration pane under Calculation you can see the data sources and their equivalant variable.  Use the variables to create simple calculations (i.e x*12-100, x+y+z, y/60*x-123).
